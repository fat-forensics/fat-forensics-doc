.. note:: **Doctest Mode**

   The code-examples in the :ref:`tutorials` and :ref:`how_to_guide` are
   written in a *python-console* format. If you wish to easily execute these
   examples in **IPython**, use the::

   %doctest_mode

   `magic command`_ in the IPython-console. You can then simply copy and paste
   the examples directly into IPython without having to worry about removing
   the `>>>` manually.
