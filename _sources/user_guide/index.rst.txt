User Guide
++++++++++

This part of the documentation contains a user guide to a variety of
*Fairness*, *Accountability* and *Transparency* algorithm. As opposed to the
rest of the documentation, the user guide is focused on describing the
theoretical and implementation (from a functional requirements point of view)
aspects of FAT algorithms when applied to the three main components of a data
processing pipeline: *data*, *models* and *predictions*.

Each entry in the user guide gives the description of the method, intended
use of the method, available implementations in a variety of programming
languages, best practices, advised usage and caveats, among many other listed
properties.

Fairness User Guide
===================

The *Fairness User Guide* discusses techniques used for *detecting*,
*measuring* and *mitigating* *bias* and *unfairness* in data and predictive
algorithms.

.. note:: Coming Soon.

.. _user_guide_accountability:

Accountability User Guide
=========================

The *Accountability User Guide* discusses *safety*, *security*,
*robustness* and *privacy* aspects of data sets and predictive algorithms.

.. note:: Coming Soon.

.. _user_guide_transparency:

Transparency User Guide
=======================

The *Transparency User Guide* tackles *interpretability* and
