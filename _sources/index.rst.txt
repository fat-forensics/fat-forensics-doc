Welcome to FAT Forensics!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

FAT-Forensics is a Python toolkit for evaluating Fairness, Accountability and
Transparency of Artificial Intelligence systems. It is built on top of SciPy_
and NumPy_, and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license (new BSD).

In addition to the code documentation, this web page also includes a detailed
:ref:`user_guide` that describes FAT algorithms on a more theoretical level
and talks about best practices when using them.

----

A great way to get yourself familiar with the package and where it comes from
is the :ref:`getting_started` page.

Source Code
===========

For hosting the source code we use the `FAT-Forensics organisation`_ on GitHub,
with the source code for the FAT Forensics packed being held in the
`fat-forensics`_ repository.

Communication
=============

We use a range of platforms for communication in the project:

* for issues with the source code or the documentation please open an issue on
  our `GitHub issue tracker`;
* the code-related development discussion should happen on our gitter_ channel;
* the discussion about the project's future and the direction of the
  development happens on our slack_ channel and `mailing list`_.

Acknowledgement
===============

The project has started as an academic collaboration between the
`University of Bristol`_ and Thales. You can find all of our contributors and
more information about the support we receive :ref:`here <contributors>`.
