[04/11/2019] Version 0.0.2 released!
====================================

Today we release an incremental update focused on surrogate explainability of
black-box models for tabular data -- a collection of techniques and algorithms
that we call *build LIME yourself* (**bLIMEy**). The changelog summarises the
functionality added with this release: :ref:`changelog_0_0_2`.

This code release comes with a new *how-to* guide:
:ref:`how_to_tabular_surrogates`. We have also added one more code example --
:ref:`sphx_glr_sphinx_gallery_auto_transparency_xmpl_transparency_tree.py` --
and updated the LIME code example
(:ref:`sphx_glr_sphinx_gallery_auto_transparency_xmpl_transparency_lime.py`)
to use the bLIMEy implementation of LIME
(:class:`fatf.transparency.predictions.surrogate_explainers.TabularBlimeyLime`)
instead. The ":ref:`tutorials_prediction_explainability`" tutorial has also
been updated to use bLIMEy instead of LIME.

Surrogate explainability for image and text data is coming soon so stay tuned.
